# Crawlr #

Curated and collaborative urban adventures to share with friends. Crawlr pinpoints the user's location with the geolocation API then calls Google Places to find restaurants, bars, and points of interest in the immediate vicinity. Only spots that are currently open, and have a rating greater than 4, are displayed to the user.

Steps to run:
* gulp
* node index.js

To do:
- implement Material UI
- add loader
- map spots with Mapbox
- persist data with PostgreSQL
- add filtering by price, rating, and type of establishment
